            The VA home loan entitlement is one of the most underused VA benefits available to 
            veterans, mainly because realtors and some lenders don't understand how they work and 
            make it sound complicated, which deters buyers. The amount the Department of Veterans 
            Affairs (VA) guarantees on a home loan, which helps determine how much a veteran can 
            borrow without a down payment. Essentially, it's the maximum amount the VA will repay a 
            lender if a veteran defaults on the loan. Use the fields below to determine what your total 
            entitlement is. If you already have a VA backed Home-loan, this tool can show you how 
            much entitlement you have left.
